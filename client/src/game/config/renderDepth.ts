 * The draw order of everything stacked on the player.
 *
 * These used to be bare numbers written at each call site, and the ordering
 * that resulted was accidental: rounds and the player body were both on 8, so
 * which one covered the other came down to creation order, and shot traces sat
 * on 9 alongside the weapon — meaning the rail rifle's 190px trace was drawn
 * over the gun that fired it.
 *
 * Fractions are deliberate. The surrounding scene numbers its layers in whole
 * steps and this stack has to slot between two of them without renumbering
 * anything else.

/**
 * How the rig mirrors itself when the player turns around.
 *
 * Not `setFlipY`, and the difference is not cosmetic. Phaser's flip keeps the
 * sprite's bounding box where it is and mirrors the pixels inside it:
 *
 *   if (flipY) { y += -frame.realHeight + displayOriginY * 2 }
 *
 * That is a reflection about the box's centre, not about the origin. The two
 * only agree when the origin is centred, and none of the rig's are — so the
 * anchor point itself moves by `2 * (originY - 0.5) * height` the moment the
 * player faces left. The weapon's grip jumped 4px, the far arm's elbow 7px, and
 * the trigger arm's shoulder 0.7px, which is exactly why that one looked fine
 * while the other two did not.
 *
 * A negative scale is the same reflection without the box correction, so the
 * origin stays put and the mirror is true.
